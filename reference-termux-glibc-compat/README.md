# termux-glibc-compat

Focused Linux compatibility for running glibc applications natively inside an
unrooted Termux app sandbox—without putting every syscall through PRoot's
`ptrace` tracer.

This is an early research and implementation project. The native glibc patch
now passes its public API suite from an official Termux package on the tablet,
and the authenticated Steam client plus CEF now run through that loader without
a Steam-host PRoot tracer. A thermally matched three-run game benchmark is
complete; the Proton game boundary currently retains one explicit PRoot process.

## Why this exists

The companion
[`steamclienttermux`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux)
project runs Valve's native ARM64 Steam client and Windows games on a Samsung
Galaxy Tab S8+. A live Tomb Raider (2013) profile measured the outer PRoot
tracer using 60–65% of one CPU core while GPU utilization remained only
12–16%. That makes removing PRoot from the hot path the largest structural
performance opportunity.

The goal here is deliberately narrower than “rewrite glibc”:

1. use the existing Termux glibc packages and loader;
2. measure the kernel/API differences that block real applications;
3. implement only the missing compatibility behavior at stable libc
   boundaries; and
4. keep ordinary files, sockets, futexes, graphics, and process execution on
   their native kernel paths.

No order-of-magnitude speedup is promised. The first success criterion is a
correct native Steam client launch with no PRoot tracer; game benchmarks come
after correctness.

## What upstream already provides

The official Termux glibc package is more than a relocated stock glibc. At
upstream commit
[`954c6b2`](https://github.com/termux/glibc-packages/commit/954c6b200aa001088fcc420550b9304dd81229b8),
it already:

- suppresses NPTL robust-list registration on Android;
- provides Android-backed System V shared-memory functions; and
- routes unsupported syscalls through explicit fallback handling.

The remaining measured gap is System V semaphores. Termux glibc currently maps
`semget`, `semctl`, `semop`, and `semtimedop` to `ENOSYS`. Steam required
working semaphore metadata plus wakeups after `SETVAL`, `SETALL`, and successful
operations in the PRoot implementation.

## Repository status

The first milestone is checked in:

- strict C probes for pthread creation, robust-list behavior, SysV semaphore
  wakeups, and cross-process SysV shared memory;
- a tested in-memory semaphore-set core with generation-safe IDs, Linux-like
  key lookup, atomic `SETALL` validation, and all-or-nothing multi-operation
  evaluation;
- a version-1, explicitly little-endian and bounded request/response protocol,
  plus a strict dispatcher exposing every completed state-core operation;
- a runnable `tgcompatd` Unix-socket broker with mode-0700 runtime-directory
  validation, a mode-0600 socket, and same-UID `SO_PEERCRED` authentication;
- concurrent client workers and broker-side FIFO `semop` wait/wakeup handling;
- ownership/mode/timestamp metadata, `GETNCNT`/`GETZCNT`, `IPC_INFO`,
  `SEM_INFO`, indexed `SEM_STAT`/`SEM_STAT_ANY`, and monotonic `semtimedop`
  deadlines;
- Linux-compatible per-process `SEM_UNDO` accounting, including process-exit
  restoration observed with `pidfd_open` and a `/proc` fallback;
- a lazy, persistent, per-thread native client API that reconnects safely after
  `fork`, closes its connection at thread exit, and never allocates or
  reconnects in steady-state calls;
- a pinned Termux glibc 2.44 package overlay that preserves public symbol and
  time ABIs while replacing only the semaphore syscall boundary;
- a successful build through the official pinned `termux/glibc-packages`
  recipe, followed by extraction-only and content-addressed tablet validation;
- a successful real `libc.so` link and public-API probe through that built
  loader against `tgcompatd`;
- an opt-in, no-copy execution shim that runs unmodified Linux ELF children
  through the selected loader and preserves `argv[0]` across Steam's imported
  `execv`, `execvp`, `execvpe`, `execl`, and POSIX-spawn call paths;
- an opt-in scheduler shim that changes only the exact `Raknet-RecvFrom`
  thread's zero-delay `sched_yield()` polling into a bounded real sleep;
- an evidence-backed compatibility matrix;
- a no-ptrace architecture for a per-Termux-UID semaphore broker; and
- a staged path from probes to a patched Termux glibc package and native Steam
  experiment.

The first native Tab S8+ run is also captured: pthreads and cross-process SysV
shared memory pass; robust-list and SysV semaphore calls return `ENOSYS`. This
established the original compatibility baseline. See
the [raw result](docs/results/2026-08-16-tab-s8plus-glibc-2.42.txt).

The native Bionic broker is now built and execution-tested on the same tablet.
All seven state/protocol/transport/client suites pass, including fork handling,
blocking wakeups, timed waits, and process-exit `SEM_UNDO`. A 20,000-operation
optimized pass measured 9,226 complete persistent-client `GETVAL` calls per
second. See the [device result](docs/results/2026-08-16-tab-s8plus-native-broker.txt).

The current `glibc_2.44_aarch64.deb` has SHA-256
`52f5ce13b66fc3307f48285d32b72951472493e91b96fc3e08c0c42772d999f3`.
Its own loader resolves the public semaphore probe against only the extracted
candidate libraries, and both the full control/wakeup test and upstream glibc
2.44 `test-sysvsem` pass against the same-UID broker. This includes signal
interruption of a blocked `semop`, reconnect after cancellation, and oversized
timeout `EOVERFLOW` behavior. The package is selected under
`~/.local/share/tgcompat/glibc`; the active `$PREFIX/glibc`, official Steam
depot, and saved login state remain unchanged. See the
[device package result](docs/results/2026-08-16-tab-s8plus-glibc-test-sysvsem.txt).
The integration overlay and its exact upstream pin are documented in
[`integration/termux-glibc/README.md`](integration/termux-glibc/README.md).

## Native Steam and controlled Tomb Raider result

The content-addressed glibc host now runs the real authenticated ARM64 Steam
client, CEF, networking, X11, and PulseAudio while retaining the saved login.
The controlled Tomb Raider launch reached the real executable 29.244 seconds
after the Runtime request and its first 2800x1752 window at 58.256 seconds.
The earlier all-PRoot observation needed 407.236 seconds to reach the window:
the native-host launch interval is **85.7% shorter, or 6.99x as fast**. The
schema-v2 timing artifact is retained in the companion repository:
[`tomb-raider-native-supervised-cold-20260817.json`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux/blob/main/docs/launch-timings/tomb-raider-native-supervised-cold-20260817.json).

The first controlled game series used panel-native 2800x1752 Low, V-Sync off,
one warm-up, three recorded passes, and automatic full-policy/thermal cooldown.
At 119.92 Hz X refresh it averaged 15.767/32.567/23.400 FPS, 5.4% above the
prior PRoot-host 22.2 FPS average. Changing only Samsung Motion smoothness to
Standard produced a verified 59.97 Hz X surface and
16.200/34.500/**25.167 FPS**, another 7.6% average-FPS improvement. Average-FPS
median improved from 22.7 to 25.3. Both exact series are retained in the
companion repository:
[`119.92 Hz control`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux/blob/main/docs/benchmark-series/tombraider-native-glibc-safe-119hz-20260817.json)
and
[`59.97 Hz A/B`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux/blob/main/docs/benchmark-series/tombraider-native-glibc-safe-60hz-20260817.json).

At the same 59.97 Hz state, a bundled-Proton FEX repeat required the warm-up
and every recorded pass to start below a fixed 40 C ceiling. It averaged
12.500/32.967/23.567 FPS from 37.0-37.6 C starts, 6.4% below `safe` at
25.167 FPS; average-FPS medians were 22.8 and 25.3. A subsequent matched `fast`
profile series averaged 16.367/32.300/23.800 FPS from three 37.0 C starts. It
was 5.4% below `safe`, only 1.0% above bundled Proton, and had a 23.0 FPS
average median. `safe` remains the selected profile. The exact matched series
are retained as the
[`bundled-Proton artifact`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux/blob/main/docs/benchmark-series/tombraider-native-glibc-proton-60hz-40c-20260817.json)
and
[`fast artifact`](https://github.com/huntergdavis/steamclienttermux/blob/main/docs/benchmark-series/tombraider-native-glibc-fast-60hz-40c-20260817.json).

The display change improved throughput but did not eliminate thermal policy
loss. Every recorded pass in both series began at full CPU/GPU policy and ended
with the GPU capped at 492 MHz/thermal level six. The 60 Hz improvement may
therefore reflect lower presentation work or contention without producing a
lower final thermal state.

This result also narrows the remaining engineering work. Native glibc removed
PRoot from Steam, but Android denied Bubblewrap's user namespace with `EINVAL`
and mount namespace with `EPERM`. The Runtime/Proton/FEX path therefore still
uses the existing PRoot filesystem boundary. Removing that hot-path tracer
requires a bindless preconstructed Runtime/Proton launch layout or another
userspace containment design; additional semaphore or robust-list emulation
alone cannot grant the kernel namespaces.

`build/libtgcompat-exec.so` is an execution-boundary helper, not a syscall
emulator. It reads only the target ELF header at launch time and wraps matching
AArch64 Linux executables with `TGCOMPAT_LD_SO`; program files are never
patched or copied. `TGCOMPAT_LIBRARY_PATH` supplies the loader search path and
`TGCOMPAT_EXEC_DISABLE=1` is a fail-safe bypass. When a host rewrites
`LD_PRELOAD` for a child with incompatible objects, an explicitly supplied
`TGCOMPAT_EXEC_LD_PRELOAD` replaces that child value only at a wrapped Linux
ELF boundary. An explicit child value wins; otherwise the opt-in policy is read
from the calling process so a launcher cannot accidentally discard it while
rebuilding a game environment. Leaving it unset in both places preserves the
caller's environment. The test fixture gives its
target a deliberately nonexistent interpreter and verifies direct, PATH-based,
variadic, and spawned child launches through the real selected loader.
Direct execution or `posix_spawn` of that configured guest interpreter path is
also redirected to `TGCOMPAT_LD_SO`; this covers launchers that invoke
`/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` themselves instead of relying on an ELF
`PT_INTERP` entry.
`TGCOMPAT_EXEC_SHELL=/absolute/glibc/sh` additionally redirects only exact
`/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/sh` requests before that ELF decision. This opt-in is
for launchers that hard-code an Android-visible shell even though the command
they are constructing belongs in the selected glibc environment; it applies
uniformly to direct, variadic, PATH, and `posix_spawn` entry points.
An exact `TGCOMPAT_EXEC_PATH_FROM=/absolute/source` plus
`TGCOMPAT_EXEC_PATH_TO=/absolute/target` pair provides the same coverage for a
single configured launcher boundary. Both variables must come from the child
environment or both fall back to the calling process; partial or relative
policies are ignored. The original `argv[0]` is preserved.

`build/libtgcompat-android-root.so` is a separately gated experiment. Android
denies a read-open of `/proc/self/root`, while an `O_PATH` descriptor is usable
for Valve's fd-relative traversal. With `TGCOMPAT_ANDROID_ROOT_O_PATH=1`, the
shim retries only that exact read-directory failure. This moved native
Pressure Vessel to Bubblewrap on the Tab S8+, but the kernel then returned
`EINVAL` for user namespaces and `EPERM` for mount namespaces. It is therefore
tested groundwork, not a replacement for the game-boundary PRoot process.

The same shim can expose a validated userspace route shadow to native Wine.
Android denies unrooted apps access to `/proc/net`, which makes Wine report no
usable network even though ordinary sockets work. Setting
`TGCOMPAT_PROC_NET=/absolute/private/directory` redirects read-only opens and
metadata queries for `/proc/net`, `/proc/self/net`, and
`/proc/thread-self/net` to that directory. Mutation requests are never
redirected. The caller remains responsible for validating the directory and
its `route`/`ipv6_route` files before enabling the policy.

`TGCOMPAT_PROC_STAT=/absolute/private/file` similarly redirects read-only opens
and metadata queries for exactly `/proc/stat`. It does not affect
`/proc/self/stat` or mutation requests. This lets a caller provide CPU topology
to glibc software when Android denies the real aggregate proc file; the caller
must validate and maintain the synthetic file.

`build/libtgcompat-robust.so` is a narrowly gated Steam compatibility
experiment. Valve's ARM64 IPC code queries `get_robust_list(0, ...)` and aborts
when Termux glibc returns `ENOSYS`. With `TGCOMPAT_ROBUST_LIST=1`, the shim
returns a separate, lazily initialized Linux-compatible head for each thread
plus glibc's immediately preceding list-backlink word, and forwards every
other syscall. This satisfies the userspace list contract Steam checks, but
Android still does not register the head with the kernel. Kernel owner-death
recovery is therefore not claimed.

The same syscall-boundary shim has a separate
`TGCOMPAT_USERFAULTFD_ENOSYS=1` policy for Android. It returns `ENOSYS` only
for the native `userfaultfd` number and Proton 11 ARM64's temporary-header
fallback number 374. Proton uses this optional probe for kernel write-watch;
Wine already disables that optimization when the call returns an error.
Android's app seccomp policy raises fatal `SIGSYS` instead, so the shim restores
the failure contract without attempting to emulate userfaultfd.

`TGCOMPAT_FLOCK_FCNTL=1` is another independent policy in that preload. The
Tab S8+ removable Steam-library filesystem returns `ENOSYS` for
`flock(LOCK_SH | LOCK_NB)` even though it accepts whole-file POSIX record
locks. Steam interprets the failed lock as a reader-allocation failure and
labels otherwise readable depot chunks corrupt. The shim calls the real
`flock` first and, only on `ENOSYS`, maps shared/exclusive/unlock operations to
`F_SETLK` or `F_SETLKW`. The fallback is intentionally opt-in because POSIX
record-lock ownership is not generally identical to Linux `flock` ownership.

`build/libtgcompat-mprotect.so` handles executable mappings backed by Android
removable or other `noexec` storage. Termux's packaged glibc replaces stock
`mprotect` with a fallback that parses `/proc/self/maps`; its current
[`__is_mmaped` implementation](https://github.com/termux-pacman/glibc-packages/blob/main/gpkg/glibc/mprotect.c)
can free pointers advanced into a tokenized allocation. The resulting heap
abort was reproduced while Wine mapped a game image from an SD-card Steam
library. Preloading this shim makes the raw syscall first and, only for
`EACCES` plus `PROT_EXEC`, replaces the rejected range with a byte-identical
anonymous mapping before applying the requested protection. The fallback uses
no heap allocation or `/proc` parsing. `make check-mprotect-shim` exercises the
path with deterministic fault injection.

`build/libtgcompat-raknet-recv.so` is a game-specific scheduler experiment.
With `TGCOMPAT_RAKNET_RECV_SLEEP_US=1000`, it changes public `sched_yield()`
calls into an EINTR-safe 1 ms sleep only for a thread named exactly
`Raknet-RecvFrom`. Every other thread and an unset/zero policy retain the real
call. This targets RakNet's empty-receive `RakSleep(0)` busy loop under Wine;
it neither skips socket reads nor changes general Wine scheduling. Use
`make check-raknet-recv-shim` for the exact-thread and disabled-path contract.

## Run the broker

The socket directory is part of the security boundary. It must belong to the
current UID and have exact mode 0700:

```sh
install -d -m 0700 "$HOME/.cache/tgcompat-run"
./build/tgcompatd --socket "$HOME/.cache/tgcompat-run/broker.sock"
```

`TGCOMPAT_SOCKET` can provide the same absolute path. Startup refuses to
replace an existing path; a normally stopped broker removes its own socket.

## Run the probes

On conventional Linux:

```sh
make check
make benchmark
```

On Bionic/Android, `make check-broker` runs the complete broker, protocol,
transport, client, fork, timeout, and `SEM_UNDO` suite without conflating those
results with the separate host-libc capability probes. `make check` also works
when Termux's `libandroid-shmem` and `libandroid-sysv-semaphore` development
packages are installed; the build selects those Bionic link shims
automatically. Android seccomp `SIGSYS` is reported as `UNSUPPORTED`, not as a
false semantic pass. Glibc behavior must still be tested through
`glibc-runner`.

The runner reports `PASS`, `UNSUPPORTED`, or `FAIL`. `UNSUPPORTED` is a useful
Android baseline, not a false pass. A broken implementation that advertises a
feature but violates its semantics is `FAIL`.

The benchmark excludes daemon startup and reuses one authenticated connection,
matching the intended native-client hot path. It reports `PING` and `GETVAL`
round-trip latency and throughput; tablet results, not workstation numbers,
are the performance gate. Method and current measurements are in
[`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

`SEM_UNDO` behavior follows the upstream Linux implementation, including its
`-32768..32767` accumulated adjustment range and clearing adjustments after
`SETVAL`, `SETALL`, or removal. The broker tracks one authenticated process,
not one client thread, so all connections from the same process share the undo
list just as Linux threads using `CLONE_SYSVSEM` do.

For a stripped LTO build:

```sh
make release
```

The production helper selects ThinLTO under Clang, parallelizes the build, and
tunes for kernel-reported CPU features by default:

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh --native --check
```

The helper parallelizes compilation but runs Android capability probes and the
broker gate outside the parallel GNU make jobserver. This avoids a reproduced
Termux make 4.4.1/Scudo self-crash after `SIGSYS` probe children; it does not
weaken any test.

Use `--portable` for a redistributable binary. Published binaries deliberately
do not assume one ARM core design. On heterogeneous AArch64 Android devices the
helper deliberately avoids `-mcpu=native`: Clang can select the largest core
and emit SVE instructions that Android does not expose uniformly. A post-link
broker/client smoke benchmark rejects such unusable builds immediately.

The session helper owns a private runtime directory and performs PID/executable
validation before signaling anything:

```sh
scripts/tgcompat-session.sh start
eval "$(scripts/tgcompat-session.sh env)"
# launch any patched-glibc application here
scripts/tgcompat-session.sh stop
```

`scripts/tgcompat-session.sh run COMMAND...` combines startup and environment
setup. It leaves the broker alive so child processes and subsequent Steam games
keep the same compatibility service; `stop` shuts it down explicitly.

`build/libtgcompat-client.a` contains the caller-owned persistent client. Its
public API is [`include/tgcompat/client.h`](include/tgcompat/client.h); negative
errno results are preserved for the thin glibc boundary to translate.

On Termux, compile the probes with the same glibc toolchain used by the target
runtime. Do not use the ordinary Bionic-linked `gcc` alias to infer glibc
behavior:

```sh
pkg install glibc-repo glibc-runner gcc-glibc
glibc-runner -s 'make clean && make CC=gcc'
glibc-runner -s 'bash scripts/run-probes.sh --no-build'
```

## Design constraints

- Unrooted Android and the normal Termux application UID.
- No `ptrace`, root service, custom kernel, or global Android modification.
- No `LD_PRELOAD` claim for glibc-internal raw syscalls.
- Same-UID local IPC only; peer credentials and filesystem permissions are
  part of the protocol boundary.
- Linux-compatible blocking, atomic multi-operation, removal, and waiter
  wakeup behavior before performance work.
- Honest separation between client-host compatibility and the later Steam
  Runtime/Pressure Vessel namespace problem.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design and
[`docs/BASELINE.md`](docs/BASELINE.md) for the measured starting point.

## Provenance

This project starts from measurements, probes, and the 244-line Android PRoot
IPC patch in `steamclienttermux`. The required recall query
`deja "Steam ARM64 Termux replace PRoot native glibc runner robust list SysV IPC"`
returned no indexed prior implementation, so no undocumented session solution
was reused.
